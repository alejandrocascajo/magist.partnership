### Magist Partnership (Brazil expansion)

## Summary
This **initial project*** in the Data Analytics Course at WBS Coding School focuses on Eniac, a company specializing in the sale of electronic accessories compatible with Apple devices. Eniac is considering a swift expansion into Brazil’s e-commerce market through a 3-year partnership with Magist, a Brazilian SaaS leader in order management and after-sales services. This collaboration would provide crucial market entry support, but concerns remain regarding Magist’s capability for handling high-end tech products and delivery efficiency. **Analyzing Magist’s data** will guide Eniac's decision on whether to move forward with the deal.
